For this project, I am making a NBA/Basketball game simulator. I am inspired by the gameplay of NBA 2K game. In this sport-game player is able to control one player, or the whole team from NBA to compete with another team based on AI-controlled. However, in most modes of NBA 2K, system will provide entire NBA league for player to play with. Except for the team controlled by player, games between other teams in the league are automatically generated by system AI. Player is able to check and read the detail of each game happened in the virtual league even though the game is not participated by player. In most cases, the result seems enough believable. 
Normally, I am trying to build a simple version of NBA Match Simulator which has similar function to the generator in NBA 2K game.

This project is a continuer of one of my previous class project. It was originally made using Progressing 2. This time I build the entire project by python and pygame, also add graphic elements. Screenshots and an executable file are attached in this folder.  

The simulator runs as two teams are competing on a basketball court. User can launch stats board by pressing 's' and progress game by pressing 'p'. In Court mode, game window will present the court scene where user can see how ball is moving and passing between players. Stats board is made for presenting detail stats info for each player on court.

The simulator is not running in a complete random mechanic. Each player is detailed defined by several rating stats (Screenshot 5), for example shooting skill, rebound skill, block skill. Therefore player with higher rating skill may have better performance in corresponding case.

The simulator is build by python and pygame library. Sourcecode can be found in this folder as well. To run sourcecode, please install pygame library first.

Thank you very much.
